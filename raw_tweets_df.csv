Being a veteran online shopper, I tried @Instacart for the first time. Spent a bit of time placing my order only to be told at checkout that no delivery times were available. They gave me the option of picking up my order at 2 stores - 45 minutes away!

It will be my last time.

First few symptoms, here it comes.
I'm fucked. I was also doing instacart because both of my jobs (at a school and catering) have no work for weeks if not months.
Now I'm probably sick. Cool. And all I can do about it is write this status and hashtag because they won't test me.

I used Instacart for the 1st time.  Shopper messaged me around 11:00 am while shopping.  Was told the food would be delivered tomorrow....after sitting where?  Not safe to eat anymore.  Who's handling it/ $130 drain.   Waited on hold 90 minutes for nothing.

Oh instacart, quit with the lies and cover-up. Customers, did you know if your shopper leaves the store receipt with you they get deactivated? Because instacart doesn't want you comparing the two receipts. Makes you wonder ..

I use Instacart, prime now and shipt and they are backlogged a few days out.   The alternative is target curbside and they load your bags - though you do have to leave.

Good luck!

Great local alternative to grocery delivery services like Instacart for people looking for local goods. You can read about their safety practices within the questions under their tweet. Hope they can expand their offerings because they‚Äôre already sold out of a lot! 
Dan Riley added,

 @tgfarmersmarket
We‚Äôre at it again, #STL ! We can deliver within a 10-mi radius of Tower Grove Park. We have 250 boxes available, and we're working with @eatherestl to increase that # to as many as 500 by next week! Eat well & be well. We‚Äôre in this together. To order: https://stlfmllc.square.site/s/order

@Instacart I took an order at 8:45 this evening . Unfortunately, Karns closes at 8pm. Therefore the customer's order is still open and it can not be cancelled.  Also this should not be counted against me since Instacart doesn't have their stores hours correct.

All extremely high turnover positions. Instacart for example needs 300k because they‚Äôll be lucky to get work out of ~<20% of them, of that 10% will do 1 gig and realize it‚Äôs a bad value prop. Typically only 3-4% of gig workers stay on past 6 gigs

If you're looking online, keep cart full in instacart. Sometimes it'll say no slots until weekend (they aren't even listing pickup at all), but both time I ordered & later, had openings today as they caught up. Mine said delivery in 5 hrs, but she shopped/delivered right away.

We have tried ordering online. We tried instacart. We tried order online & pick up. It doesn‚Äôt work at any grocery store in our area. 

The only way to get groceries is to shop in person and it gives me massive anxiety every single time.

It's causing me so much extra anxiety because I have no $ until nxt wk & stores are empty of so much stuff. Top it off, we're high risk so every trip I take could be a problem. Instacart was mad expensive, long wait & most of our order wasn't filled because of everything sold out

I‚Äôm only using Twitter to do this because @Instacart won‚Äôt respond directly and hasn‚Äôt refunded their money. I know workers and delivery people across PG County are all stressed from the high demand but the delays, then stolen order, now silence from corporate are unacceptable.

Being a veteran online shopper, I tried @Instacart for the first time. Spent a bit of time placing my order only to be told at checkout that no delivery times were available. They gave me the option of picking up my order at 2 stores - 45 minutes away!

It will be my last time.

Aren't Instacart drivers essentially on-demand talent (ala Uber drivers)?? If so, these wouldn't be ""hires"", but sign-ups. Technically they may receive a W2, but I'd bet they average less than 10 hrs per week.

Um, someone needs to get to the bottom of this number.  Walmart says they're hiring 150k more, Amazon 100k more.  Instacart, with 9% of online grocery shoppers (Forrester data), is hiring more than both of those companies combined? That sounds fishy.

@Instacart still can't get through to a person, can't get an answer to emails, and no reply here. Order marked as delivered, never arrived. $ and time wasted trying to get food to a mother and child.

Should have clarified those things I mentioned got replaced with similar things. The only thing they didn't have was the Clorox disinfecting cleaner I wanted but I kind of figured that would be out. Luckily I still have some 70% isopropyl alcohol.

So I had risk breaking quarantine to go out & get groceries (again, fuck you @Instacart ), and folks, please buy from your small local markets. They‚Äôre hurting for business and they are SUPER well stocked rn.

Get over your weird xenophobia & shop more international markets.

Hello contactless delivery, the tip is auto-filled at 10% not 2% (in Canada at least), & anyone who can afford to would likely increase that amount as additional incentive anyway - because, yes, shopper's are basically heroes right now. @instacart @dailyvoluptuary @AshleyAmagyar

Could shoppers get some hazard pay? As, well as masks, gloves & hand sanitizer?

They're putting themselves at risk to shop & deliver groceries for others. 

The pay  is not reflective  of the risk.

If you use a service such as Instacart to deliver your groceries be sure you check your receipt against what you receive. If you get charged for items you didn't order/receive, only way to get your money back is to go into the store you wanted to avoid. Instacart won't help you.

I tried it about a year ago, worked out pretty well. Aldi lends itself to idiosyncratic shopping (tend to buy mostly the same items). There is a markup on items aside from other fees, but the woman who grabbed it all & delivered it was great. Tipped well, should've tipped more.

There are other local businesses on Instacart if you want to keep supporting those without going inside (wait times are about a week last I checked early this morning but full now too same as HEB). Wheatsville, Natural Grocers, Tomlinson's, Sprouts, Specs, Central Market & Costco

My wife used it for the first time this weekend.  Awesome app.  Interesting byproduct of this crisis, there is a good chance I never go to a grocery store again.  Even when it‚Äôs over.

I was able to find available slots for delivery about a week from now a couple days ahead of the HEB curbside schedule on Instacart, but only very early this morning, now it is all full again.

Instacart is a somewhat functional alternative to ordering from the HEB app or website directly. Their fee is $4 per delivery ($5 on HEB app) and you can tip the driver, plus there are a few other fees involved.

Hi Marty. I placed an order yesterday through Instacart for Loblaws ( In Canada) for delivery and we were assigned a 4 hour window delivery time yesterday (which was pushed back twice) and we still have not gotten our order 24 hours later.

In times like this, we FEEL the need for robot delivery services for groceries.

I use Amazon Fresh or Instacart for groceries but the next delivery drop-off is 5 days from now. 

Same day delivery is not an option and I cant just go out in grocery store where all the people are.

All extremely high turnover positions. Instacart for example needs 300k because they‚Äôll be lucky to get work out of ~<20% of them, of that 10% will do 1 gig and realize it‚Äôs a bad value prop. Typically only 3-4% of gig workers stay on past 6 gigs.

@Instacart Our shopper has just finished collecting all our groceries, but now he is saying we need to cancel the order because the Instacart card is not working. What can we do? We need these groceries today, and have a high-risk person in the household so cannot go out.

I am not going back up there.  Here is a copy of your pricing from Instacart.  Please take note, the Bethlehem, GA store was not willing to provide family pkgs of thighs or bone-in chicken at the price of just a little over $2 a pound, only family pkgs for the higher product.

One of the big chains here uses Instacart, but it has a 5% service charge + a delivery fee when small stores are offering free delivery (and now they have waiting lists a mile long!). Another chain store charges $15! Really, you‚Äôd think they cld drop their fees in these times.

@Instacart So I placed a large first order, albeit with some skepticism, for us and our elderly moms. Of course I forgot to add the coupon code I had sitting in front of me for free delivery and $20 off. Can you please fix this for me? I tried everywhere on the app and on line

The problem I'm seeing, at least in my area, is that with stores that already have these services in place (like Walmart, Instacart pick-up, etc), pick-up time slots are booked solid, days/weeks out, and have been for the last 2 weeks. Same goes for delivery.

Has anyone added up the hiring announcements from Amazon, Instacart, others?

Feels like a significant chunk of the newly unemployed are going to end up employed in the delivery infrastructure... the only kind that's left when everything is shut down.

Dont use .@instacart unless you just feel like being ripped off.  Was charged for an order that was never delivered.  Most likely the shopper just kept it for himself then lied and said he delivered it

Publix/InstaCart, their delivery vendor are price gouging customers. They add del fee($3.99)request a tip, then auto add it or increase it). Charge fees as a % of the original order, but don‚Äôt drop the svc fee when amount drops. #PublixPriceGouging

3/ Similarly, if a worker gets sick, paid sick leave pays their wages based on the # of days worked. But while Instacart has temporarily extended its paid sick leave policy, this is not a substitute for the full protections they are entitled to under state and local law.

@Instacart maybe you should stop bundling 2-3 orders for us to take for a total (with tip!) of $15. Maybe you should get your support staffed better instead of worrying about hiring more shoppers. Pay the current shoppers better.

We placed a curbside pickup order from @Wegmans this afternoon, but I just read that the person that brings it out to the car is not the same person that does the shopping. Does anyone know how to tip the @Instacart worker in this scenario? I‚Äôll feel so bad if we don‚Äôt! #ithaca

Besides that Instacart lies!  They send you a notification that your groceries are delivered when they are never are.  Happened to me twice in one day!  And you are on hold for hours when you call their customer service!!

Also if one delivery person get's sick another one will pick up the slack. Instacart is basically independent contractors so anyone who's not sick can pick up orders.

I'm not a big fan of instacart in this period of time. You're essentially risking someone else's health to get your groceries. What we need is for grocery stores to step up and offer curbside service to limit contact, period.

The people I know delivering for Instacart are doing so as a second job; they have health care coverage at their primary job that costs a fortune.  Hence a second job.  Just because a job doesn't have health care does not in itself mean it is bad.  Health care costs are the issue

@Instacart We love you! Been a member for a while. Hospitalized for 9 days, just home to have my husband go down w/this, your shoppers are our angels. I chat & tell them we are quarantined. They leave it outside and text us. I blow them a kiss from the window. Thank God for you!

@Instacart few of your delivery people keep handing us things directly getting close and we must sign their phone which can‚Äôt be safe, do you have guidelines for their safety and to help not spread this thing? They are all nice and great and I want to make sure they‚Äôre safe.

First time using #DoorDash - #EpicFail. Ridiculous upcharges, delivery fee, driver tip -- then I don't get half my order. Then to add insult to injury, instead of refunding my money, they issue a ""Door Dash Credit"" that I can use ""towards a future order."" Really? Not again.

...I'm mad at myself. I could have gotten IHOP before it closed on DoorDash. I could have had a damn country fried steak and some pancakes and sides for dinner because I'm in that kind of mood.

What‚Äôs Capriottis? Never heard of em.and would love to experience the food in the future while attending a @PostMalone concert! Sucks covid 19 cancelled the show I was going to go to in Ontario, Ca. But way more important to stay home and try to flatten this curve.

@DoorDash makes its delivery drivers pay for masks, gloves, and sanitizers. These essentials SHOULD BE FREE! Even if it‚Äôs only shipping. These are essentials to keep your workers employed.

Be willing to deliver beyond two blocks. What's frustrating to me is when my fave restaurants won't deliver to certain zip codes. Then I'm forced to use the apps.

They do this while also paying their drivers a pittance by the way. We get about $2 base (slightly increased when the distance is longer). Our actual pay is entirely based on tips. Which customers pay on top of service fees.

Get on postmates or doordash, so you can more efficiently get stuff out to people and you‚Äôve got more eyeballs on your store.

Then, pivot just a bit - keep selling your menu items, but...

No care seen here. I placed a delivery and then it was cancelled. But no refund in sight. The total included the Door Dash driver's tip as well. Popeyes was the one to choose to deliver through Door Dash and Popeyes is the one who charged my card in full.

#GreatAmericanTakeout as someone who works in the restaurant industry programming point of sales software, the best way to contribute to a small restaurant by far is calling them directly and paying cash. credit cards and doordash/ubereats/etc have extra fees. cash has none.

PSA: if you order DoorDash and you don‚Äôt tip be prepared to wait a while. We see the order total prior to us accepting it and none of us are going to rush to deliver your food for $3. 
Our base pay is $3 + your tip. Keep that in mind :)

@Doordash @doordash_help You need to revisit payouts with this whole shelter-in-place thing going on. Restaurants shutting down means more drive throughs open, means longer wait times. You have GOT to give us longer delivery and pickup times. Especially on these small orders.

The new law stopping evictions doesn't actually stop evictions. They will still start the process to evict you, but the city will give you paperwork to fight it, IF YOU QUALITY. But will I qualify if i theoretically COULD do my @DoorDash job, but am self-isolating for safety?

My family door dashes and have taken precautions to make sure we are not spreading anything. Also door dash has an option to leave at door so no face to face contact happens. For people who can't go to the store or cook its best option.

Doordash is doing a no contact thing and it is actually helping people stay in their homes. The business is booming and that means the spread isn't. Alot of the dine out places are also doing no contact. People can still deliver. Just be safe about it.

The one thing you can to support local restaurants right now is to order directly and skip the third party delivery apps! Local restaurants need CASH today, and they have to wait a few weeks to get money from those Apps, so don't use @UberEats @Seamless @Grubhub or @DoorDash!

The level of greed of delivery apps taking advantage of restaurants during the #CoronavirusLockdown is downright shameful.

If you order food through a service like @bitesquad, @Grubhub, @DoorDash, etc. and you don't tip the person, any other time you would just be a jackass but during #COVID19 when they are risking sickness you are the biggest piece of shit around. Don't order if you can't tip.

If you order from UberEats, DoorDash, etc., please tip! The # of people I have delivered to the past few days who ended up tipping $0 is astounding. I‚Äôm risking my health so you can get your burger (and so I can pay my rent). Please think of that when hitting the no tip button.

Never use a delivery app. We drive and pick up the food ourselves unless the restaurant has its own drivers. In a large Coty that‚Äôs hard. But in south Florida not a problem.

I just learned the other day if you tip through the app, the whole tip goes to the driver but Door Dash then cuts what they pay the driver. Door Dash guarantees them a certain amount per hour and once tips and pay reach that amount, Door Dash starts cutting pay.

Not a fan of acting like the tip going to the driver is a bad thing. Drivers rely on tips to make money too. On an app like postmates, you get paid a pretty small amount of money to make a delivery, and most of your income actually comes from tips.

Will they forgo distance limits? I've delivered for postmates, and one if the advantages is that distance is no issue. An incremental delivery fee with no distance limit would be ideal.

I would like to point out, having worked for both DoorDash and Grubhub; (Likely will again because I just got fired.) That on average the payouts for a lot of deliveries is anywhere from $2-5 base pay. They don't cover any costs of the driver.

The convenience is for the consumer more than the restaurant. I don‚Äôt know how many resto need delivery to survive rather than expand. Consumers should bear the delivery costs. Restos should be charged marketing. 25-30% is too much for the service.

Don‚Äôt order through door dash!! They don‚Äôt try to find your house/apartment. And if they call and u don‚Äôt answer they will keep your food and don‚Äôt give a refund or return it to the restaurant.

Today is #GreatAmericanTakeoutDay! Prioritize local businesses always that use sustainable packaging when possible! One way to do so is using the ""sustainable packaging"" filter in delivery services like DoorDash.  Where are you ordering from today? #supportlocal

DoorDash, along with lifting commissions for some restaurants, is offering ""Leave it at my door"" vs. ""Hand it to me"" delivery options. 

Which, I'm sure, would be a ""Seinfeld"" subplot at this point.

.@Grubhub please stop airing the commercial where the doorbell rings multiple times in rapid succession.  It's driving my dogs nuts and making me angry...to the point where I have a negative association with Grubhub and order from Doordash during this shutdown.

Restaurants and customers need to go back to direct. Not sustainable otherwise. Companies like @ChowNow enable direct online / mobile ordering with no take rate.

Can you remind some of the larger chains on the platform ie. @ChipotleTweets @umamiburger etc. that the dashers also use restrooms and that closing them to us in the current state of affairs with EVERYTHING else closed makes it a bit difficult for US to keep THEIR orders filled..

We are doing curbside pick up only.

Delivery might be the only option for some people, but we think of the drive to the restaurant as our weekly date  Plus, we're going to try new-to-us places, maybe find some new gems for The Great After.

Hi, I‚Äôm a Postmates driver. 

Do you realize the costs associated with maintaining an app with this volume, and how much it would actually cost to employ more than one reliever driver? 

Could you not try to take away my way of making income when I‚Äôve already lost other avenues?

Support your local restaurants who are still doing takeout, but do the following:

1. Call them directly to order‚Ä¶
2. ‚Ä¶ which means don‚Äôt use a service like @UberEats, @DoorDash, etc. They don‚Äôt tip the people in the restaurant.
3. Tip like you‚Äôre eating there!

Don't forget DoorDash and GrubHub !  They are amazing, and have been doing a great job with wearing gloves, and leaving the bag by the door.  They will pick up from so many restaurants-most, locally owned (some chains).

It‚Äôs hard to support restaurants if @Instacart @DoorDash @UberEats and every other delivery company does not issue a directive to their employees to leave deliveries at the door. It‚Äôs in the delivery instructions and people still ignore it.

Services like Doordash take 20% off the top of the restaurant bill.  And that is off razor thin margins for restaurants. So if you can, go pick up the takeout vs relying on these services during this shelter at home time. This will help all local establishments survive.

@DoorDash It‚Äôs time to do away with the rating system for drivers. Temporarily if you must, but permanently preferred. We are at risk of our income being affected because a restaurant forgot to put extra ranch in a sealed bag or similar.

I've been wondering how DoorDash would work these days, if I run low on food. Do you have any new tips that you've noticed lately? Any particular franchise restaurants handling #COVID19 precautions better than others?

P.S. Do people tip less with ""no contact"" drop off?

This is a boon for all delivery companies, and the bigger chains should negotiate commissions down since there are a lot more deliveries. That of course won‚Äôt happen because bigger chains would be happy to see smaller players either and die. YUM actually has a stake in grubhub.

My tita said that if she is that concern, she should just stay home and have things delivered in Instacart & Grubhub.

Discrimination and Ignorance go hand in hand. It is present without any consideration of place and time and in any situation even it's the end of mankind.

People who work with food must have a food handlers card. They know the necessary precautions when handling food. No one exposed would even be permitted to be at work. Spires offers postmates, Grubhub and many other delivery services so you don‚Äôt have to leave your house.

Needless to say I‚Äôm heated. What I paid for was way more expensive than what I received so naturally I call to complain. First I started by calling Red Lobster who says sometimes GrubHub picks up multiple orders at once and they must have switched orders and to call them.

I definitely share the same opinion about @DoorDash and @Grubhub. I would say on average 50% of the orders are messed up, and 75% of the time they don‚Äôt deliver it directly to our door despite detailed instructions. These services are a great idea with horrible implementation.

The one thing you can to support local restaurants right now is to order directly and skip the third party delivery apps! Local restaurants need CASH today, and they have to wait a few weeks to get money from those Apps, so don't use @UberEats @Seamless @Grubhub or @DoorDash!

Some friendly advice to people who are looking to support small businesses during this time. The best way to do that is to order DIRECTLY  from the restaurant.

Other services (GrubHub, UberEats, Postmates, etc) take large percentages of the order. Sometimes up to 30%!

You‚Äôre likely outside of our delivery range for our app.  BUT, try ordering through one of our third party partners like UberEats or GrubHub as they may have a wider delivery radius and are offering free delivery promotions as well!

On the other end, send treats to service industry people (hygiene products, snacks, etc.). Restaurant workers, gas station attendants and so on.

Order online from walmart/target/walgreens and pick it up then drop it off.

Don‚Äôt use @Grubhub! Never again! Order was missing one meal. Grubhub said to order again if we wanted our food, but refused to refund delivery fee. Wants you to pay TWO delivery fees to get your complete order. #grubhub  #badbusiness #avoidgrubhub

GrubHub is offering to defer its marketing commission fee, which applies to delivery and takeout, for at least two weeks, (but that timeline has room for flexibility), for independent restaurants affected by the coronavirus. Restaurants opt in for the deferral.

Chelo Segear Retweeted Speaker Craig Coughlin
Last night our @Grubhub_Care driver marked our food as delivered and then drove off with it.  Won't get that money back for 3-5 business days. Nothing else was open after waiting 1.5 hrs. Got a refund + I feel terrible for the restaurant. Can't trust grub hub

Mandatory shelter in place orders doesn't mean you have to eat the expired can food in the back of your pantry.  

Find us on Door Dash now, and Grub Hub in the next day or two, and let us deliver a delicious meal right to your doorstep!

Just from what I remember from serve safe classes and such, there is  a minimized risk for contamination from the restaurant employees due to extra precautions. However my concern is the delivery drivers for third party delivery (Postmates, GrubHub, ect.) Who knows about them?

Just a reminder: if you choose to doordash/grubhub etc. Please do so with smaller restaurants and especially Asian restaurants. They are hurting right now with less foot traffic and people being shitty. They will lose food bc it will spoil. The big boys are fine, and if we have..

Getting a raise at the same job isn't the same as finding a job at a whole different company, which most are closed or laying off folks because of the virus.
Also, no offense, but that's a starting wage where I live.

A burger & fries costs $12. The consumer might pay up to $20 because of the service fee, tip, tax & a delivery fee... From that $12 sale, the restaurant might get to keep $9 if the commission fee is 25%.

Got a text from my Grubhub driver saying that he couldn‚Äôt find the restaurant. A minute later got the notification that my delivery was on its way. Then got another notification ten minutes later saying my order had been delivered. (Narrator voice: The order was not delivered.)

Hey so. @Grubhub City pizza stole 25$ from us, our LAST bit of money for food. We're out of food & cannot drive to get any. When we called the place they said to call y'all at @Grubhub_Care & when we did, you said only the restaurant could give us a refund. Never ordering again

I've been losing weight over the last week that I've been home (at least 3 pounds thus far). I've done nothing but lay in bed and go to the store and to Ben's house. However, I haven't been eating out because I'm too afraid to have anything delivered on Grubhub or Doordash.

Okay. Uber Eats is kind of dangerous right now. A local restaurant is doing BOGO on their pub burger and their bacon cheese fries. We ordered both. Oh and it's free delivery since it's a local business. Goodbye clean arteries.

For sure- that‚Äôs the way to do it. Although I do recall some issue w GrubHub, I believe, taking tips out of drivers earnings basically (gross oversimplification, also it was a while ago) so maybe check to make sure they get it? Or Venmo, but then there are other security steps...

I found out today that when you use uber eats, doordash, grubhub, etc. - the workers at the restaurant will get $0 tip. so if you really want to support the restaurant and it‚Äôs employees, order direct if you can (and tip really well!)

Hi all, my wife is in restaurant/bar biz and they are pleasantly surprised by takeout/curbside business. Keep it up, friends. Take a break for yourself and help your neighbor. This crap will be over before we know it.

from what i've been hearing, grubhub especially has been trying to help the local restaurant scene in a lot of areas.

they're not a perfect company, but i think it's better than nothing, and it's almost certainly better than going out yourself

We're doing both.  Grubhub and Doordash have a contact-free hand off process for pickup and delivery now.  So we do that a few days a week.  We're trying to visit the stores only one day a week.

I'm surprised any restaurants are still open. Doordash is still delivering, GrubHub, etc. I mean I know people need to eat, and it would cost people their jobs to close -- but doesn't HEALTH and STAYING ALIVE supersede all that? And not just your own lives -- but others too.

This whole virus thing has been a test of my faith for sure. I feel like God has taken away a lot that matters to me in the last few days. I lost my main source of income so Uber Eats is my only job and I haven‚Äôt worked it since Friday because my car is getting worked on.

Just got a $10 @UberEats voucher emailed to me under the pretense of facilitating support for local restaurants. They also state they've put other initiatives in place to help them. 

Have to ask, does that include waiving the extortionate cut they take from restaurant owners?

We calculated we usually spend way more on uber eats and eating out than we do on actual groceries.. so thats saving us a LOT of money. Plus my $12 a day for coffee and a muffin. Occasionally I'll search bank statements alphabetically & see just how much is spent at one cafe etc.

Learn from this situation. If you're helping your local businesses by ordering for delivery call them direct. Parasites like UberEats & Deliveroo take a huge slice so ask if they can deliver personally. #thinklocal #togetherwethrive #ItsAustraliaTime

They do this while also paying their drivers a pittance by the way. We get about $2 base (slightly increased when the distance is longer). Our actual pay is entirely based on tips. Which customers pay on top of service fees.

Just saw someone on insta ranting saying no one should be ordering Uber eats because the virus can be ingested. Sooooooooooo are you just going to stop eating in general/going to supermarkets etc because that‚Äôs the SAME THING. Fuck, people are really thick!

I gave up on food delivery apps a while back...and this, the breakdown of their fees to the restaurants and the consumer, just cements it that I made the right decision. Delivery apps are too expensive for the average wage earner.

Its annoying. I chose the zero contact option last week. The delivery guy‚Äôs manner of delivering was using the receipt like a glove. Rather than leaving it on the ground on top of a box and staying away. They come into contact with so many people in a day

Shouts to @UberEats for saying they couldn‚Äôt process my order, and then CONTINUED TO PROCESS IT without any type of confirmation! 

Ordered @Postmates instead

Now I paid $40 to get my meal twice and couldn‚Äôt get a refund because the restaurant already made it

I'm inspired by you. I just placed an Uber Eats order from a Chinese restaurant (one I have never tried, but which UE recommended to me).
Sadly, they did not have a scallion/onion pancake option...

Sigh. (@missgop)

One things for sure. Since the grocery store seems to always be out of everything I‚Äôve been ordering #UberEats, #Grubhub, and just delivery a lot more. I have a stash of tip money for deliveries I‚Äôve been blowing through too tipping really high. It‚Äôs expensive, but worth it.

Exactly we offered our services to a few local cafes but they chose Uber Eats instead? We don't take any of their profits or branding just a flat rate efficient delivery by a local taxi driver.

But for those whose businesses are closed and those who are at home but no work, they have limited funds to pull through this lockdown period. This lockdown will extend until singhala new year holidays are done so we are roughly looking at another 15- 20 days from today

I don't generally retweet. And less so for promoted tweets.

However ... 

To the extent we can, we should all support small businesses especially at this time. And @UberEats has an incentive.

We need more win-wins at this time. It's what Americans do.

Let's all do what we can!

Pizza Hut Delivery run their own delivery with their own drivers and their primary sales method was via delivery. KFC use Uber Eats as a small part of their sales (and pay a cut to Uber), most sales were in person at KFC. Very different business models and customer interaction

The one thing you can to support local restaurants right now is to order directly and skip the third party delivery apps! Local restaurants need CASH today, and they have to wait a few weeks to get money from those Apps, so don't use @UberEats @Seamless @Grubhub or @DoorDash!

Completely an unimportant ‚Äúproblem‚Äù right now but something @UberEats could easily have prevented by not allowing ordering from that restaurant after hours.  I feel bad for the driver who won‚Äôt get paid now.

One good thing about this level-4 shutdown for me is that i can no longer be tempted with UberEats and other crappy take-out food deliveries. Gonna have to cook my own food for the next 4 weeks.

Were doing well with delivery themselves - but also wanted the online ordering. (Wanted more control)

 ""I HAD TO GO AND PICK IT UP""

GLOBAL crisis be damned, take care of this now!

Uber, stop taking care of the sick drivers, people in desperate need of transportation and delivering medical supplies

Some friendly advice to people who are looking to support small businesses during this time. The best way to do that is to order DIRECTLY  from the restaurant.

Other services (GrubHub, UberEats, Postmates, etc) take large percentages of the order. Sometimes up to 30%!

As much as we travel... together for leisure, myself for work... quite familiar with food delivery apps. Wanting to support local restaurants this evening, we ordered delivery. No doubt, @eatstreet is the worst food delivery app anywhere. Thankfully Uber Eats is now in Madison.

we‚Äôve gone twice to get groceries. mostly cans, bread, condiment stuff. Cooking every other day, uber eats and leftovers in between. Pro Tip: use Uber eats coupons and stretch that deal into buying protein for leftovers you can mix with fresh cooked groceries.

The drivers also need to make money. This is their only income. The restaurants had zero problem with delivery services until now that it affects them. Many restaurants stopped doing deliveries bc of these services & now it‚Äôs an issue.

Those delivery companies are a pain in the ass. They stiff the employees at these restaurants who, whether you realize or not, are spending time away from tables/guests to do their order for no tip. And the 3rd party charges for ""extras"" they don't pay for when they order.

Here to clarify, @Bobg0045. While we're currently unable to change the coverage area or move outside that, we are growing quickly so stay tuned on when Uber Eats would be available there. You may also check the cities page: https://about.ubereats.com/en/cities/  frequently for updates.

@UberEats I think UberEats should partner with the grocery stores, to deliver groceries. There is a huge demand for that and it would really help out us UE drivers who are struggling big time as the market is so saturated. #grocerydelivery #deliverydrivers #weneedhelp

If you order from UberEats, DoorDash, etc., please tip! The # of people I have delivered to the past few days who ended up tipping $0 is astounding. I‚Äôm risking my health so you can get your burger (and so I can pay my rent). Please think of that when hitting the no tip button.

Order via Uber eats and use a pulley system to bring the food up. In your notes ask that instead of ringing your doorbell throw pebbles at your upstairs window to get your attention

Friends who use Uber Eats: how long does it take to hear back about an incorrect order? We ordered dinner on Sunday night and the order was completely wrong to the point it was inedible. We used the help feature as soon as we realized, and haven't heard anything yet.

On the other end, send treats to service industry people (hygiene products, snacks, etc.). Restaurant workers, gas station attendants and so on.

Order online from walmart/target/walgreens and pick it up then drop it off.

Not a fan of acting like the tip going to the driver is a bad thing. Drivers rely on tips to make money too. On an app like postmates, you get paid a pretty small amount of money to make a delivery, and most of your income actually comes from tips.

Apparently many many people (but I suspect mostly uber eats-style delivery drivers). Also, my downstairs neighbor, who parked there for 30 minutes while our driveway was being blocked and is the one person who has been given a ticket so far.

The convenience is for the consumer more than the restaurant. I don‚Äôt know how many resto need delivery to survive rather than expand. Consumers should bear the delivery costs. Restos should be charged marketing. 25-30% is too much for the service.

Does the SDRA have a website or link to local restaurants that are new to delivery during this situation or do we have to rely on Grubhub, Doordash Uber Eats, etc.

They‚Äôre partnered with many stores around the country. You choose a store, add what you want to the cart and place the order.

Someone goes to the store for you, shops for you, and brings your shit.

Do you read any of these tweets or just post always post an irrelevant generic response ? This is partly why so many people are frustrated with this company. The lack of customer service, extreme difficulty reaching a human for help, and complete disregard for any issues we have.

OOF I did not know that's how much the 3rd party delivery companies take from the restaurant. And how that would impact them w/o dine-in patrons. But uber eats etc drivers need money too rn and every SITUATION IS LOSE/LOSE right now!

Ride share is always a gamble. Uber over Lyft though for me. Uber has Uber eats as a profit stream during this which explains their small bump in stock price. Also they have more cash on hand than Lyft. But both to your point aren‚Äôt very profitable in a very volatile market.

Just a reminder to those of you that want to get #takeout during #Quarantine : do NOT order via UberEats/Postmates/GrubHub, etc. They will take more $$ than they should. Call the restaurant directly. Also, don't order McDonald's. Call local businesses/restaurants & support them.

I'm a food delivery driver, I assume that is considered essential...I wouldn't be out doing it if I could afford not to at my age (near 68).  I doubt anything that congress will pass is going to help me and other gig workers...we are invisible.

support local small restaurants, trucks, etc. Forget about supporting big box restaurants. And DEFINITELY do not support UberEats/Postmates/whatever - they take a huge fucking cut of the restaurant's money.

When you actually close your stores later in the week, I want you to remember you put your staff and customers at additional risk by continuing to operate through Uber eats and Deliveroo because you couldn‚Äôt let your bottom line suffer. Delivery is a seperate franchise. Pathetic.

Those restaurants generally increase their prices on delivery apps like Uber Eats. And it gives the driver business as well.

Plus, one delivery driver is a whole lot less coverage than the multiple drivers you get with Uber Eats, Postmates and the alike. 

I agree that if you do pick up, definitely call the restaurant directly. But restaurants are for sure saving money on delivery.

Friendly reminder!
If you‚Äôre under lockdown, you‚Äôve likely ordered some form of food delivery service.(DoorDash, Postmates, etc.). PLEASE tip your driver. They‚Äôre likely on a reduced hourly wage because they‚Äôre not in shop. These are people with families.

Hi all you delivery apps. I will donate $1000 and challenge others to do so, if you can figure out a way to use this money to deliver meals to the homeless or needy, and support local restaurants..... can we make this happen?

All other areas with orders in effect postmates put a statement in the news room for each.  There may be one there tonight or in the am.  But view the order and find where it says restaurants and food delivery exempt/essential & take a screen shot.  The app and card are enough ..

Didn‚Äôt know you were delivering for postmates. Uber had a coupon, although now I regret that since the order took forever longer and was missing an item. And the customer service is garbage, as no one has responded.

They do this while also paying their drivers a pittance by the way. We get about $2 base (slightly increased when the distance is longer). Our actual pay is entirely based on tips. Which customers pay on top of service fees.

Yo if you order from any delivery options like Uber eats GrubHub or Postmates and you live in an apartment n your apartment is eight floors up it's easier if you come down and get the food please be considerate of the fact that there's hardly any parking outside in the street . .

I gave up on food delivery apps a while back...and this, the breakdown of their fees to the restaurants and the consumer, just cements it that I made the right decision. Delivery apps are too expensive for the average wage earner.

Get on postmates or doordash, so you can more efficiently get stuff out to people and you‚Äôve got more eyeballs on your store.

Then, pivot just a bit - keep selling your menu items, but...
also sell the individual ingredients.

1. Why should I pay 25 dollars for an order I never recieved.
2. Why are you letting a closed restaurant take orders.

I WANT MY 25 DOLLARS BACK NOW!

@Lowes @HomeDepot I'd love to get some small starter fruit/veggie plants. They aren't a delivery option. I don't own a car, I'm supposed to stay home and there at least 4 of your stores within a couple miles of me. How can we figure out a delivery? Can you team up with @Postmates

The level of greed of delivery apps taking advantage of restaurants during the #CoronavirusLockdown is downright shameful. 

NONE of the tip you give to the apps ie UberEats, Postmates, DoorDash goes to the restaurant.  

Please call the restaurants directly for delivery!

Some friendly advice to people who are looking to support small businesses during this time. The best way to do that is to order DIRECTLY  from the restaurant.

Other services (GrubHub, UberEats, Postmates, etc) take large percentages of the order. Sometimes up to 30%!

He correctly said that ""they could not care less.""  What you wrote was the opposite. I hope that you're not a writer. Why should the restaurants lose money? Any cost should be paid by the customer. Why do restaurants agree to this? It doesn't seem worth it.

Those delivery companies are a pain in the ass. They stiff the employees at these restaurants who, whether you realize or not, are spending time away from tables/guests to do their order for no tip. And the 3rd party charges for ""extras"" they don't pay for when they order.

Never use a delivery app. We drive and pick up the food ourselves unless the restaurant has its own drivers. In a large Coty that‚Äôs hard. But in south Florida not a problem.

Or even send food to other food service workers - they're probably tired of eating the same stuff day after day. Mix it up - take care of those who are taking care of you.

On the other end, send treats to service industry people (hygiene products, snacks, etc.). Restaurant workers, gas station attendants and so on.

Order online from walmart/target/walgreens and pick it up then drop it off.

Not a fan of acting like the tip going to the driver is a bad thing. Drivers rely on tips to make money too. On an app like postmates, you get paid a pretty small amount of money to make a delivery, and most of your income actually comes from tips.

The convenience is for the consumer more than the restaurant. I don‚Äôt know how many resto need delivery to survive rather than expand. Consumers should bear the delivery costs. Restos should be charged marketing. 25-30% is too much for the service.

 I just had food delivered but I didn't order it. I keep getting delivery attempts and tell  them it's not mine. But now since the delivery people aren't staying after the food is delivered how can I get the food to the right person?

Overall price is better. Postmates fools you with lower prices on the food but delivery fees are higher. You can also choose to type in a 0$ tip. If you want to tip after your food comes, that is an option

If you have a delivery website, and are relying on Google maps for forced address verifications (looking at you @postmates) you are missing business.

Just a reminder to those of you that want to get #takeout during #Quarantine : do NOT order via UberEats/Postmates/GrubHub, etc. They will take more $$ than they should. Call the restaurant directly. Also, don't order McDonald's. Call local businesses/restaurants & support them.

Please: if you do order food for delivery, get the delivery DIRECTLY from the restaurant rather than reducing their income by ordering through Uber Eats, DoorDash, Postmates, or the like. If you want your favorite restaurants to survive, this is one way to help!

Hi, I‚Äôm a Postmates driver. 

Do you realize the costs associated with maintaining an app with this volume, and how much it would actually cost to employ more than one reliever driver? 

Could you not try to take away my way of making income when I‚Äôve already lost other avenues?

Plus, one delivery driver is a whole lot less coverage than the multiple drivers you get with Uber Eats, Postmates and the alike. 

I agree that if you do pick up, definitely call the restaurant directly. But restaurants are for sure saving money on delivery.

I did order through Postmates yesterday. Even though restaurants in my area can stay open for delivery and take out, many cannot justify staying open for only such service. I imagine it‚Äôs the same elsewhere, too.

Here's a solution, you could just hire your own drivers and boost up delivery methods like they do here in NY..this dude isn't being brave, your restaurant just never appreciated the takeout and delivery customer until you had to, and want us to feel bad because you didn't adapt

If your grocery store can actually keep food in stock to meet demand, and Postmates or some other similar grocery delivery is available, then no so long the rate of consumer purchase does not outweigh the rate of commercial stocking. Otherwise it's necessary.

Seems like it may be a good idea to add rideshare services (Uber/Lift) and personal logistics (DoorDash, Postmates) to our PPD-12 critical infrastructure :-)  #cybersecurity #resilience #criticalinfrastructure

I'm pretty sure next step is only food delivery will be allowed to go to restaurants.     

they've already shutdown the beaches.  

I have a feeling they are gonna restrict restaurants to only Uber/Grubhub/Doordash/postmates only.  

as for grocery stores.  grocery delivery next

I don't know if they're doing it there or not, but in DC, our independent bookstores are taking web/phone orders and delivering them using Postmates (or other food delivery services). It's another great way to help them move inventory and keep their lights on.

With Uber Eats, support says they'll pay you $4 when a restaurant is closed but you will NEVER see that money cause they point you to somewhere in the app that doesn't exist. Best to mark as delivered, get the money, customer just calls and gets a refund

If you ran a franchise restaurant, you wouldn't have to pay that high a percentage to corporate as a fee. It's gross. Maybe like a credit union or mutual insurance company, there should be a driver owned app. PostMates should be cheaper by the day for a buyout by employees.

Yeah, unfortunately the only delivery available to us is Sprout‚Äôs and Dominoe‚Äôs. We‚Äôre not even 5 miles away from other places that deliver all around the rest of the area.

on paper, i look like a terrible person. My postmates account has many tips of $0.00....but that's because I do cash. A guy that worked for me did deliveries on the side. He show'ed me how a normal tip just meant that postmates/door dash just pay less out of their pocket.

You advertise no delivery fee, then add a service fee, tip, and who knows if the delivery person ate part of your food (and if they are sick too), what‚Äôs the point? I might as well go get the food myself.

I love supporting local but hard to justify the fees imposed. I'd rather go pick it up so the restaurant is getting my money.

(2/2) times, the driver (2 different drivers) yelled up to our window (we're on 2nd floor) to come get our food. One went so far as to yell, ""Yo, you gotta come get this. I'm ain't walking no stairs!"".  Two orders and both were screwed up. My advice- avoid them!

Because chipotle sets up delivery with DD. The app crashed and now shows that the order was delivered when it wasn‚Äôt.... because of the crash. The driver did not block your number. Your number is protected with a third party number for your privacy.

Oh okay i'll defintely apply! And I remember too!!! Lol a kinda new-ish one i've come across that pays super good, is Instacart. You basically grocery shop for people lol. Grubhub pays good too. Postmates isn't too popular here but in Fresno it is, if you'd wanna do that.

Because a delivery charge/fee is what I pay for food to be brought to me, tax is for govt, and a tip is for the person who brought my food.

hey if you're ordering food, call the restaurant first to  arrange a pickup/see if they have their own delivery system -- apps like uberEats and postmates take around 30% of a restaurant's sales in predatory ""logistical fees"" -- doing business directly with them is best!

Waited two hours for pizza to be delivered by Postmates.

Two drivers later we get a call from the second driver and he says:

""Hey just so you know Postmates has terrible customer service. Even though I drive for them, I wouldn't recommend using this service.""

What do Walmart, Amazon, Target, Lowe's, Instacart, DoorDash, Postmates, and KFC have in common?

Employees don't get paid sick leave unless they're diagnosed or quarantined. And people can't get tested.

Sick people will work bc they can't afford not to.

If we are in it together you should bring your fees down to below the national average restaurant profit margin, which is just 6 percent. Sadly, restaurants end up subsidizing their customer's meals when customers use your service. You are a greedy middle man trying to capitalize

If you want a work around to @postmates price gouging during the #CoronaCrisis, make your delivery address close to a ""less than desirable"" location, order from that location at the correct pricing and change your delivery address at checkout. It's gross that they're doing this.

Um @Postmates are you price gouging? Ive watched a nugget meal from @McDonalds bounce from nearly $14 to $12. Neither of which are the actual cost of the item. Care to address this? #coronavirus are you taking advantage of a health crisis?

If only your delivery drivers would double check things like addresses, grabbing cutlery, your support team not being worthless and blaming the restaurant for you guys not grabbing the whole order. Or drivers getting lost and claiming the GPS was mistakenly in another town.

For sure. Gift cards and donations are the safest option right now. We ordered a couple Postmates orders this week (grocery delivery was stolen/misplaced last Sunday). We were extremely careful to place into clean containers (washing our hands) and reheat all food at high heat.

On top of that, so many companies use 3rd party delivery systems like DD or postmates, and I can tell you from experience majority of those drivers are not taking this serious.

Um @Postmates are you price gouging? Ive watched a nugget meal from @McDonalds bounce from nearly $14 to $12. Neither of which are the actual cost of the item. Care to address this? #coronavirus are you taking advantage of a health crisis?

Why? Do you live in a remote outpost that mail does not reach?

Otherwise, you should be able to use Amazon or whatever the Aussie version of delivery services like Fresh Direct, Postmates etc.

Should be plenty of delivery options if you‚Äôre in a major city.
